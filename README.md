This is an app for iOS resources, such as jailbreaks and iCloud bypasses.
It was created in Python, so you will have to install Python on your computer. Download it at: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/python-3.11.3-macos11.pkg
Once you have downloaded this file, open the installer and go through the steps to install Python on your Mac.
Open a new Terminal window from the "Other" folder in your launchpad, and type in "cd", without the "". make sure you typed it in lower case. 
Press the space bar, then drag-and-drop the Resource Center App folder INSIDE of the ReCenter App folder within the folder you just downloaded from here. Press enter.
If you did it correctly, you should notice the directory name changes in Terminal from the name of your home folder to the name of the Resource Center App folder. Example: "alwaysappleftd@AAFTD-MBP ~ % cd /Users/alwaysappleftd/Desktop/ReCenter/ReCenter\ App/Resource\ Center\ App 
alwaysappleftd@AAFTD-MBP Resource Center App % 
It should look somewhat like above, exept obviously it wouldn't say "alwaysappleftd" becase it would be from your computer not mine.
Now, finally type "python3 center.py" to run it. Remember to leave out the quotation marks and spell it with the exact same lower case like here.
Hope it works well for you!
